# Playtesting

## TownLevel
- Frederik
  - Way too hard, things happen too fast to understand what is going on. Bad introduction
  - Too many things at once (fires and enemy)
  - Could not get pass this level
- Tor-Arne
  - Second "layer": VillagerMob cannot follow through. (easy fix with collision layers)
  - Fire obstacles are quite difficult

## ForestLevel
- Frederik
  - Did not feel worth it to get the first gem, because I had to use one power to get it (effectively gaining nothing).
  - Way too easy, especially considering level 1. Expected a rise in difficulty.
- Tor-Arne
  - Pretty easy.
  - Still possible to cheat (difficult to find though)
## MountainLevel
- Frederik
  - Awesome, awesome music. 
  - Feels a little too tough, but still fun.
  - Best level design in the game
  - Hiding from snow is fun
  - 
- Tor-Arne
  - Good challenge
  - Could add more mobs
## BossLevel
- Frederik
  - Too easy
  - No understanding of why this boss is here and why it is important to beat.
- Tor-Arne
  - Too easy (Should put timer on bounce pad)
